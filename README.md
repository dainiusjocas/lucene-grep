- Multipline queries can be provided
- Queries can be loaded from a file
- Supports Lucene text analysis configuration for:
  - char filters
  - tokenizers
  - token filters
  - stemmers for multiple languages
  - predefined analyzers
- Text output is colored or separated with customizable tags
- Supports printing file names as hyperlinks for click to open (check support for your terminal [here](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda))
- Text output supports templates
- Scoring mode (disables highlighting for now)
- Output can be formatted as JSON of EDN
- Supports text input from [STDIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin))
- Supports filtering files with [GLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) [file pattern](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-)
- Support excluding files from processing with GLOB
- Compiled with [GraalVM native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/) tool
- Supports Linux, MacOS, and Windows
- Fast startup which makes it usable as CLI utility

Startup and memory as measured with `time` utility on my Linux laptop:
<img src="docs/time-memory-usage.png"
alt="Startup time and memory usage" title="Startup time and memory usage" />

The default output has a format: `[FILE_PATH]:[LINE_NUMBER]:[LINE_WITH_A_COLORED_HIGHLIGHT]`

NOTE: Not compatible with `grep`. When compared with `grep` the functionality is limited in most aspects.

## Quickstart

Grab a binary from [Github releases](https://github.com/dainiusjocas/lucene-grep/releases), extract, and place it anywhere on the path.

In case you're running MacOS then give run permissions for the executable binary:
```shell
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine lmgrep
```

Then run it:
```shell
echo "Lucene is awesome" | ./lmgrep "Lucene"
```

## Examples 

Example of the `lmgrep`:
```shell
./lmgrep "main" "*.{clj,edn}"
=>
./src/core.clj:44:(defn -main [& args]
./deps.edn:22:   :main-opts   ["-m" "cognitect.test-runner"]}
./deps.edn:24:  {:main-opts  ["-m" "clj-kondo.main --lint src test"]
./deps.edn:28:  {:main-opts  ["-m clj.native-image core"
```

The default output is somewhat similar to `grep`, example:
```shell
grep -n -R --include=\*.{edn,clj} "main" ./
=>
./deps.edn:22:   :main-opts   ["-m" "cognitect.test-runner"]}
./deps.edn:24:  {:main-opts  ["-m" "clj-kondo.main --lint src test"]
./deps.edn:26:   :jvm-opts   ["-Dclojure.main.report=stderr"]}
./deps.edn:28:  {:main-opts  ["-m clj.native-image core"
```

Supports input from STDIN:
```shell
cat README.md | ./lmgrep "monitor lucene"
```
TIP: write your Lucene query within double quotes.

Various options with GLOB file pattern example:
```shell
./lmgrep --case-sensitive\?=false --ascii-fold\?=true --stem\?=true --tokenizer=whitespace "lucene" "**/*.md"
```
TIP: write GLOB file patterns within double quotes.

We can exclude files also with a GLOB pattern.
```shell
./lmgrep "lucene" "**/*.md" --excludes="README.md"
```
TIP: a GLOB pattern is treated as recursive if it contains "**", otherwise the GLOB is matched only against the file name.

Provide multiple queries:
```shell
echo "Lucene is\n awesome" |  lmgrep --query=lucene --query=awesome
=>
*STDIN*:1:Lucene is
*STDIN*:2: awesome
```

Provide Lucene queries in a file:
```bash
echo "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" | ./lmgrep --queries-file=test/resources/queries.json --format=json
=>
{"line-number":1,"line":"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"}
```

The contents of the Lucene queries file is in JSON format, e.g.:
```json
[
  {
    "query": "fox"
  },
  {
    "query": "dog"
  }
]
```

NOTE: when the Lucene queries are specified as a positional argument or with `-q` or `--query` params or with the `--queries-file`, all the queries are concatenated into one list.

## Deviations from Lucene query syntax

- The field names are not supported because there are no field names in a line of text.

  -h, --help
```

NOTE: question marks in `zsh` shell must be escaped, e.g. `--case-sensitive\?=true` or within double quotes e.g. `"--case-sensitive?=true"` 

## Text Analysis

The text analysis pipeline can be declaratively specified with the `--analysis` flag, e.g.:
```shell
echo "<p>foo bars baz</p>" | \
  ./lmgrep \
  --only-analyze \
  --analysis='
  {
    "char-filters": [
      {"name": "htmlStrip"},
      {
        "name": "patternReplace",
         "args": {
           "pattern": "foo",
           "replacement": "bar"
        }
      }
    ],
    "tokenizer": {"name": "standard"},
    "token-filters": [
      {"name": "englishMinimalStem"},
      {"name": "uppercase"}
    ]
  }
  '
=>
["BAR","BAR","BAZ"]
```

The action inside `lmgrep` is as follows:
- char filters are applied in order:
  - `htmlStrip` is applied, which removes `<p>` and `</p>` from the string (i.e. `foo bars baz`)
  - `patternReplace` is applied, which replaces `foo` with `bar` (i.e. `bar bars baz`)
- tokenization is performed (i.e. `[bar bars baz]`)
- token filters are applied in order:
  - `englishMinimalStem` which stems the tokens (i.e. `[bar bar baz]`)
  - `uppercase` is applied (i.e. `[BAR BAR BAZ]`)
- The resulting list of tokens is printed to STDOUT.

You can peel the analysis config layer by layer and see what are the intermediate results.

For the full list of supported analysis components see the [documentation](docs/analysis-components.md).

### Default text analysis

If analysis is not specified then the default analysis pipeline is used which looks like:
```shell
--analysis='
{
  "tokenizer": {
    "name": "standard"
  },
  "token-filters": [
    {
      "name": "lowercase"
    },
    {
      "name": "asciifolding"
    },
    {
      "name": "englishMinimalStem"
    }
  ]
}
'
```

### Predefined analyzers

```shell
echo "dogs and cats" | ./lmgrep --only-analyze --analysis='{"analyzer": {"name": "English"}}'
=>
["dog","cat"]
```
Note that stopwords were removed and stemming was applied.

The full list of predefined analyzers can be found [here](docs/predefined-analyzers.md).

### Tips on Analysis Configuration

Analysis configuration must be a valid JSON and for your case it might make sense to store it in a file.

Store analysis in a file:
```shell
echo '{"analyzer": {"name": "English"}}' > analysis-conf.json
```

Run the text analysis:
```shell
echo "dogs and cats" | ./lmgrep --only-analyze --analysis="$(cat analysis-conf.json)"
```

If your JSON spans multiple lines ask a little help from `jq`:
```shell
echo "dogs and cats" | ./lmgrep --only-analyze --analysis=$(jq -c . analysis-conf.json)
```

### What about resources for analyzers?

Some token filters require a file as an argument, e.g. `StopFilterFactory` requires `words` which is a file.
By default, the Lucene would load the file under `words` from the classpath.
However, `lmgrep` is a single binary and there the notion of the classpath makes little sense.
To support such analysis components that expects files the Lucene class that loads files was patched to support arbitrary files.

E.g. create a stopwords file:
```shell
echo "foo\nbar" > my-stopwords.txt
```
Run the analysis
```shell
echo "foo bar baz" | \
  ./lmgrep \
  --only-analyze \
  --analysis='
  {
    "token-filters": [
      {
        "name": "stop",
        "args": {
          "words": "'$HOME'/.lmgrep/my-stopwords.txt"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  '
=>
["baz"]
```
See the custom stopwords was removed.

Creating files in arbitrary places might be OK for one-off scripts.
However, it creates some mess.
Therefore, consider creating a folder for your analysis component resources such as: `$HOME/.lmgrep`.

```shell
export LMGREP_HOME=$HOME/.lmgrep
echo "foo\nbar" > $LMGREP_HOME/my-stopwords.txt
echo "foo bar baz" | \
  ./lmgrep \
  --only-analyze \
  --analysis='
  {
    "token-filters": [
      {
        "name": "stop",
        "args": {
          "words": "'$LMGREP_HOME'/my-stopwords.txt"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  '
=>
["baz"]
```

### Analysis in the queries file

Every query in the queries file can provide its own configuration, e.g.:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "0",
    "query": "dogs",
    "analysis": {
      "analyzer": {
        "name": "English"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "1",
    "query": "dogs",
    "analysis": {
      "tokenizer": {
        "name": "whitespace"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

For each unique analysis configuration a pair of Lucene Analyzer and an internal field name is created.
Then Lucene Monitor is run over all queries, and their respective fields with their own analyzers for every text input.

## WordDelimiterGraphFilter

Using WordDelimiterGraphFilter filter might help to tokenize text is various ways, e.g.:

```shell
echo "test class" | ./lmgrep "TestClass" --word-delimiter-graph-filter=99
=>
*STDIN*:1:test class
```

```shell
echo "TestClass" | ./lmgrep "test class" --word-delimiter-graph-filter=99
=>
*STDIN*:1:TestClass
```

The number 99 is a sum of options as described [here](https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_4_0/analyzers-common/constant-values.html#org.apache.lucene.analysis.miscellaneous.WordDelimiterGraphFilter.CATENATE_ALL).

## Phrase Matching with Slop

To match a phrase you need to put it in double quotes:
```shell
echo "GraalVM is awesome" | ./lmgrep "\"graalvm is\""
=>
*STDIN*:1:GraalVM is awesome
```

By default, when phrase terms are not exactly one after another there is no match, e.g.:
```shell
echo "GraalVM is awesome" | ./lmgrep "\"graalvm awesome\""
=>
```

We can provide a slop parameter i.e. `~2` to allow some number of "substitutions" of terms in the document text, e.g.:
```shell
echo "GraalVM is awesome" | ./lmgrep "\"graalvm awesome\"~2"
=>
*STDIN*:1:GraalVM is awesome
```

As a side effect, when the slop is big enough terms can match out of order, e.g.:
```shell
echo "GraalVM is awesome" | ./lmgrep "\"awesome graalvm\"~3"
=>
*STDIN*:1:GraalVM is awesome
```
However, if order is important there is no way to enforce it Lucene query syntax.

## Development

Requirements: 
- Clojure CLI
- Maven
- GraalVM with the `native-image` tool installed and on `$PATH`
- GNU Make
- Docker (just for rebuilding the linux native image).

Build executable for your platform:
```shell
make build
```
It will create an executable binary file named `lmgrep` stored at the root directory of the repository.

Run the tests:
```shell
make test
```

Lint the core with clj-kondo:
```shell
make lint
```

## Print results with a custom format

```shell
./lmgrep --template="FILE={{file}} LINE_NR={{line-number}} LINE={{highlighted-line}}" "test" "**.md"
```

| Template Variable     | Notes                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `{{file}}`            | File name                                                 |
| `{{line-number}}`     | Line number where the text matched the query              |
| `{{highlighted-line}}`| Line that matched the query with highlighters applied     |
| `{{line}}`            | Line that matched the query                               |
| `{{score}}`           | Score of the match (summed)                               |

When `{{highlighted-line}}` is used then `--pre-tags` and `--post-tags` options are available, e.g.:
```shell
echo "some text to to match" | lmgrep "text" --pre-tags="<em>" --post-tags="</em>" --template="{{highlighted-line}}"
=>
some <em>text</em> to to match
```

## Scoring

The main thing to understand is that scoring is for every line separately in the context of that one line as a whole corpus.

Another consideration is that scoring is summed up for every line of all the matches. E.g. query "one two" is rewritten by Lucene into two term queries.

Each individual score is BM25 which is default in Lucene.

## Future work

- [ ] Optimize matching by [processing lines in batches](https://github.com/dainiusjocas/lucene-grep/issues/3)
- [ ] Automate builds for [multiple platforms](https://github.com/dainiusjocas/lucene-grep/issues/9)
